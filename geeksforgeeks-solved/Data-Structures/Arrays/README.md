## Arrays - Introduction

In this subsection, you will find my solutions to problems from various sub-topics in the Array Data Structure.  

In the initial stages these 3 questions were fundamental to my understanding of arrays.

## What are arrays?
- Arrays are collections of data elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Arrays are typically used when we want to store a collection of elements of the same type.
- Arrays are typically 0 indexed 
- Arrays have fixed size.

## When do we use arrays
- Arrays are useful for fast retrieval of data elements if index of that element is already known.
    - In this case, element retrieval is random and is done in O(1) time

## Why do we use arrays
- Traditionally, we can use variables to store data elements in memory, but for a larger number of data elements, its is better to use Arrays.
